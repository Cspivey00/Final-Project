# Final-Project

Part I: a project proposal.  An outline of your project, copies of data, an initial sketch of the idea, and the identified method you'll use for presenting. (Draft #1: Due 2/9)

## Outline of Project

I am planning on mapping immigration into the United States from other countries. I'd like to look at the total immigration and break it down by countries of immigrants, where immigrants are settling inside of the US, under what programs people immigrate (IE: Refugees, Asylum, I9, Etc.), and other potential areas of interest.

I will be using official government immigration statistics from DHS.Gov for the 2018 year, as well as potential years prior to 2018 to provide historical context. For the purpose of this presentation I will mainly focus on contemporary policy decisions under the Trump administration and provide historical context when necessary. 

These files are available in excel format and I will use tableau to analyze and graph the data. If Tableau proves to be challenging then I will upload and work with Arc GIS to map them. 

### Below is the link for the data:

### Sketeches of Data

### Presentation of Data

I will be using Shorthand to present the data. Ideally, I will have a general overview tab that will be used for my 60-second presentation in class which will include: Why immigration matters, three to five graphs explaining recent immigration trends, a quick analysis of what this story means, and a call to action. Additionally, I will have other shorthand tabs explaining the breakdown of each graph, how I arrived at that visualization, and what story each one tells. Finally, I will have a final project tab that will be a culmination of the final report. 

#### One Sentence Summary

Immigration is critical part of the US economic and cultural growth and we should advocate for better immigration policies to enhance the number of immigrants into the United States. 

*My thought process is that the immigration system has been a controversial topic in the last decade, and that the US Congress should create a better immigration system that works more efficienctly. We are seeing stagnated levels of immigration which doesn't reflect the level of populatiion growth worldwide or amount of immigrant applications to the United States.*

#### What should Readers Understand

My thought process is that the immigration system has been a controversial topic in the last decade, and that the US Congress should create a better immigration system that works more efficienctly. We are seeing stagnated levels of immigration which doesn't reflect the level of populatiion growth worldwide or amount of immigrant applications to the United States.

In short, I would like to convey why the topic of immigration is important and advocate for improving our immigration policies.
