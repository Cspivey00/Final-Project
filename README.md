# Final-Project

#Part I: a project proposal.  An outline of your project, copies of data, an initial sketch of the idea, and the identified method you'll use for presenting. (Draft #1: Due 2/9)

## Outline of Project

I am planning on mapping immigration into the United States from other countries. I'd like to look at the total immigration and break it down by countries of immigrants, where immigrants are settling inside of the US, under what programs people immigrate (IE: Refugees, Asylum, I9, Etc.), and other potential areas of interest. I will need to define the term immigration as DHS defines it in its data set -- Permanent residents and immigrants not counting temporary status'. 

I will be using official government immigration statistics from DHS.Gov for the 2018 year, as well as potential years prior to 2018 to provide historical context. For the purpose of this presentation I will mainly focus on contemporary policy decisions under the Trump administration and provide historical context when necessary. 

These files are available in excel format and I will use tableau to analyze and graph the data. If Tableau proves to be challenging then I will upload and work with Arc GIS to map them. 

### Below is the link for the data: 

<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2018" target="_blank">This is the Immigration Yearbook Data for 2018 as well as historical data for previous years</a>

### Sketeches of Data

Below are some choices of how I will break down Immigration to the United States. I need to clean the data and aggregate the data for each type of immigration program (PR, refugee, asylum, and non resident immigration) to gauge the total level of immigration. Furthermore, I would like to break it down by origin (Both region and State level), Demographics, settlment inside of the US, and the program used to enter the US. This is just a rough idea of the many ways to view the information.

I used infogram to sketch what these graphs and maps may look like. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" data-type="interactive" data-title="Mapping Immigration "></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Mapping Immigration </a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

### Presentation of Data

I will be using Shorthand to present the data. Ideally, I will have a general overview tab that will be used for my 60-second presentation in class which will include: Why immigration matters, three to five graphs explaining recent immigration trends, a quick analysis of what this story means, and a call to action. Additionally, I will have other shorthand tabs explaining the breakdown of each graph, how I arrived at that visualization, and what story each one tells. Finally, I will have a final project tab that will be a culmination of the final report. 

#### One Sentence Summary

Immigration is critical part of the US economic and cultural growth and we should advocate for better immigration policies to enhance the number of immigrants into the United States. 


#### What should Readers Understand

My thought process is that the immigration system has been a controversial topic in the last decade, and that the US Congress should create a better immigration system that works more efficienctly. We are seeing stagnated levels of immigration which doesn't reflect the level of populatiion growth worldwide or amount of immigrant applications to the United States.

In short, I would like to convey why the topic of immigration is important and advocate for improving our immigration policies. 

### Call To Action

I would like to use this as a way to inform people why immigration reform is important. I would like to ask citizens to advocate their local, state, and federal representatives to take action. 

*This call to action could be expanded or worked on, but other than advocating directly to our representatives there's not a lot the general population can change about this specific topic.*

# Part II Wireframes, Storyboards, Moodboards, and User Research

For the user research on my wireframs and story arc I used a seperate GitHub page linked <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2018" target="_blank">here</a> which allowed me to present the rough ideas to my interviewees without providing the entire story. This helped in narrowing the provided information to just the graphics and brief descriptions focusing the responses on whether or not the graphics would be effective/useful.
