# Final-Project

#Part I: a project proposal.  An outline of your project, copies of data, an initial sketch of the idea, and the identified method you'll use for presenting. (Draft #1: Due 2/9)

## Outline of Project

I am planning on mapping immigration into the United States from other countries. I'd like to look at the total immigration and break it down by countries of immigrants, where immigrants are settling inside of the US, under what programs people immigrate (IE: Refugees, Asylum, I9, Etc.), and other potential areas of interest. I will need to define the term immigration as DHS defines it in its data set -- Permanent residents and immigrants not counting temporary status'. 

I will be using official government immigration statistics from DHS.Gov for the 2018 year, as well as potential years prior to 2018 to provide historical context. For the purpose of this presentation I will mainly focus on contemporary policy decisions under the Trump administration and provide historical context when necessary. 

These files are available in excel format and I will use tableau to analyze and graph the data. If Tableau proves to be challenging then I will upload and work with Arc GIS to map them. 

### Below is the link for the data: 

<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2018" target="_blank">This is the Immigration Yearbook Data for 2018 as well as historical data for previous years</a>

### Sketeches of Data

Below are some choices of how I will break down Immigration to the United States. I need to clean the data and aggregate the data for each type of immigration program (PR, refugee, asylum, and non resident immigration) to gauge the total level of immigration. Furthermore, I would like to break it down by origin (Both region and State level), Demographics, settlment inside of the US, and the program used to enter the US. This is just a rough idea of the many ways to view the information.

I used infogram to sketch what these graphs and maps may look like. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" data-type="interactive" data-title="Mapping Immigration "></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Mapping Immigration </a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

### Presentation of Data

I will be using Shorthand to present the data. Ideally, I will have a general overview tab that will be used for my 60-second presentation in class which will include: Why immigration matters, three to five graphs explaining recent immigration trends, a quick analysis of what this story means, and a call to action. Additionally, I will have other shorthand tabs explaining the breakdown of each graph, how I arrived at that visualization, and what story each one tells. Finally, I will have a final project tab that will be a culmination of the final report. 

#### One Sentence Summary

Immigration is critical part of the US economic and cultural growth and we should advocate for better immigration policies to enhance the number of immigrants into the United States. 


#### What should Readers Understand

My thought process is that the immigration system has been a controversial topic in the last decade, and that the US Congress should create a better immigration system that works more efficienctly. We are seeing stagnated levels of immigration which doesn't reflect the level of populatiion growth worldwide or amount of immigrant applications to the United States.

In short, I would like to convey why the topic of immigration is important and advocate for improving our immigration policies. 

### Call To Action

I would like to use this as a way to inform people why immigration reform is important. I would like to ask citizens to advocate their local, state, and federal representatives to take action. 

*This call to action could be expanded or worked on, but other than advocating directly to our representatives there's not a lot the general population can change about this specific topic.*

# Part II Wireframes, Storyboards, Moodboards, and User Research

For the user research on my wireframs and story arc I used a seperate GitHub page linked <a href="https://cspivey00.github.io/Part-II-Wireframe-Test/" target="_blank">here</a> which allowed me to present the rough ideas to my interviewees without providing the entire story. This helped in narrowing the provided information to just the graphics and brief descriptions focusing the responses on whether or not the graphics would be effective/useful. 


### Research Response

User #1 -- 44yr old, female, BA Degree: 
a. What story do you think these graphics are trying to convey?
That the year that has the highest amount of immigration numbers was 1991
b. Are these graphics interesting? Do they provoke any emotion or action?
Yes they are interesting mainly because immigration numbers have actually decreased over time yet this is one of the most debated political topics in the US right now.
c. Are these graphics clear?
Yes 
d. What did you like about them? 
I like the fact they are interactive.  So for example any where you hover is more information instead of just a graph where you are trying to guess the number of immigrants.  You actually give a number associated with each year and place.... 
e. What did you dislike about them? 
The 'Immigration Annually 1820-2018' is a little cramped looking
f. How, if applicable, would you change these graphics? 
Is there a way to correlate the 'Immigration Population by State' to the 'Annual Immigration by Region Chart'? use the color codes off the Annual Immigration by Region to show who is immigrating to what states?
g. Is there any information you feel is unnecessary?  
Maybe the gender graph?  Im not sure what role the age and gender play as they aren't apart of any other portion of the website
h. Is there any information you feel is missing? 
Why does the 'Immigration Program Numbers Annually 2016-2018' only focus on 3 years and not go further back like the other charts
i. Is there any information you feel is unclear or misleading? 
No
j. On a scale of 1-10 how would you grade these graphics in creating a story? 
7 - because you have to take into account the reason for higher and lower immigration and I don't think you can do that with a graph... Like for example what happened in 1991 that increased the number of immigrants compared to the rest of the years etc...
k. How likely, if at all, are these graphics to motivate you to reach out to your political representatives surrounding the issue?
It wouldn't.
l. Is there any additional feedback you would like to provide? 
i think the information provided is good but if the point is to have people be motivated to do something about immigration you need to provide additional information that will spark a reason for people to be motivated. 

Interviewee #2 - 28yr old male, MS degree;

- I get the feeling the graphics are trying to portray some sort of nuanced take on immigration, as they clearly reflect an attempt to describe the issue in great depth rather than focus on one specific story or even crucial but somewhat emotional issues like the refugee crisis
- For some of the images, like age and gender and  "immigrant population by state" be clear over what time period you're measuring (a single year or longer?) even if just in a footnote
- Get rid of the arrows in "Countries of Origin" graph. We already know they're coming to the U.S. 
- I liked the "Annual Immigration by region" graph. It was clear and tells a story many people might not be aware of.
- It would depend on exactly what point you're trying to make, but for "immigration 1820-2018" the graph doesn't tell the whole story because the overall population of the U.S. was far lower in the past, so immigrants as a share of population might have been higher than they are now.

Interviewee #3 -- 27yr old female, law degree


a. the story is of the current state of immigration. 
b. Yes. 
c. Mostly. The interactive map was fun. 
d. I like the use of color and different mediums other than charts. 
e. I thought the origin map was kinda ugly. 
f. I would change the origin map to be more visually appealing. 
g. No. 
h. No 
i. No.
j. 7 k. Not likely, but only because I am overly knowledgeable on the subject and already lobby and advocate for immigration reform. 
l. No

### User Research protocol

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

A)	I would like to reach a large audience of americans. This requires creating a storyboard that can span job industry, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and other demographic characteristics. However, I would like to specifically engage audiences that are likely, or very likely, to be politically active with the end of goal of advocating for political activism. (Because the audience is so broad I didn’t find it pertinent to make a persona for this group)
a.	Secondary audience – politicians 
B)	I will interview three or more people that represent different ages, education levels, genders, and political leanings. 
C)	User Research Questions:
a.	What story do you think these graphics are trying to convey? 
b.	Are these graphics interesting? Do they provoke any emotion or action?
c.	 Are these graphics clear? 
d.	What did you like about them? 
e.	What did you dislike about them? 
f.	How, if applicable, would you change these graphics? 
g.	Is there any information you feel is unnecessary? 
h.	Is there any information you feel is missing? 
i.	Is there any information you feel is unclear or misleading?  
j.	On a scale of 1-10 how would you grade these graphics in creating a story? 
k.	How likely, if at all, are these graphics to motivate you to reach out to your political representatives surrounding the issue?
l.	Is there any additional feedback you would like to provide?

*It’s worth noting that normally I would not ask someone such a long list of questions, however there are only going to be 3-5 people interviewed so I think that being thorough is worthwhile in this case.*

D) The findings are attached above. 

E) I found the reviews to be helpful -- especially concerning the clarity of the story arc and which pieces of information I should focus on or draw attention to. The following are some of the pieces I plan to change or implement:

I will implement a flowchart from XYZ Region to ABC State/Region inside of the United states. 
I plan to change the 1820-2018 graph. I assumed it might be too much historical context and the review was proven correct.
I need to play with some of the map rendering to make sure that it formats correctly. Especially on mobile sites.
The graphics alone are not motivating thus I need to provide more context to people and have a specific call to action. 
I'm considering editing the demographic data or eliminating it -- atleast for the purposes of the '60 second presentation'. 
The color schemes could be improved, significantly in some cases -- this will be easier once I use a program such as tableau to improve the graphics. 
I found that one of the interviewees was confused about my purpose -- clarifying would be useful. 
Interviewee #2 brought up some interest points -- The one that I thought might make the most sense is displaying immigrants as a % of the population. 
Also, I need to remove the arrows on the countries of origin page-- it is quite busy and I figured that might be an issue. (One participant said it was ugly... guess that could be scrapped.)
Use more interactive maps and get more creative with the approach
